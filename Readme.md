# For Derrick and other editors

Main files:
- `index.html`: only HTML file, where all content for this single-page static site lives
- `/assets/css/style.css`: only CSS file
- `/assets/css/js/main.js`: only js file I've tweaked. Only made minor tweaks, for the Gallery/Portfolio functionality
- `/assets/img/`: all images. The gallery / portfolio images are inside the `portfolio` sub-folder

Deploy by committing and pushing on the branch `static-site`. This triggers a GitHub Action. Watch deploy progress
